# Security Guidelines

## Overview

The Hasebny Payroll System handles sensitive employee and financial data. Security must be a top priority in all aspects of development and deployment.

## Data Protection

### Financial Data

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All financial data stored in Firebase should be encrypted
2. **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmission should use HTTPS/TLS
3. **Access Controls**: Only authorized personnel should access payroll data
4. **Audit Logs**: All modifications to payroll data should be logged

### Personal Data

1. **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure all personal data handling complies with applicable regulations
2. **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary personal information
3. **Right to Erasure**: Implement procedures for data deletion requests

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles

1. **Admin**: Full access to all system features
2. **Employee**: Limited access to personal data only

### Authentication Best Practices

1. Use Firebase Authentication for secure user management
2. Implement multi-factor authentication for admin users
3. Enforce strong password policies
4. Implement session timeout mechanisms

### Authorization Controls

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure users can only access data appropriate to their role
2. **Data Filtering**: Server-side filtering to prevent unauthorized data access
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation

1. Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
2. Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
3. Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Dependency Management

1. Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
2. Use npm audit to identify vulnerable packages
3. Review third-party libraries for security issues

### Error Handling

1. Never expose stack traces or system information in production
2. Log errors securely for debugging purposes
3. Implement proper error boundaries in React components

## Firebase Security

### Firestore Rules

Implement comprehensive Firestore security rules in `firebase.rules`:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Employees can only read their own data
    match /employees/{employeeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == employeeId;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/employees/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Payroll data is admin-only
    match /salaries_{year}_{month}/{employeeId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/employees/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Leave requests
    match /leaveRequests/{employeeId}/{requestId} {
      // Employees can read their own requests
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == employeeId;
      // Employees can create requests
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == employeeId;
      // Admins can update status
      allow update: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/employees/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## Audit Logging

### Required Logs

1. **User Authentication**: Log all login/logout events
2. **Data Access**: Log access to sensitive data
3. **Data Modification**: Log all changes to payroll data
4. **System Events**: Log system errors and anomalies

### Log Format

Each log entry should include:
- Timestamp
- User ID (if authenticated)
- Action performed
- Data affected
- IP address
- User agent

### Implementation

Audit logging is implemented in `src/lib/audit-logger.ts` and provides:
- Employee data modification tracking
- Payroll calculation logging
- Leave request action logging
- Attendance record logging

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Procedure

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Investigation**: Determine scope and cause of breach
3. **Notification**: Inform affected parties as required by law
4. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities that led to breach
5. **Documentation**: Record incident and lessons learned

### Regular Security Audits

1. Conduct quarterly security reviews
2. Perform penetration testing annually
3. Review access controls regularly
4. Update security policies as needed

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements

1. **Local Labor Laws**: Ensure compliance with Saudi Arabian labor regulations
2. **Data Protection Laws**: Comply with GDPR or other applicable data protection regulations
3. **Financial Regulations**: Follow any applicable financial reporting requirements

### Documentation

Maintain documentation for:
1. Security policies and procedures
2. Incident response plans
3. Compliance requirements
4. Audit trails
